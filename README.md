# Explore-Weather-Trends
Udacity Data Analyst Degree - Project I

## Overview
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

## What Software Do I need?
To complete this project, i'll require the following softwares:
- SQL
- Excel

## Extracting Data
To start I wrote an SQL query to retrieve all the temperature data from:
- Local Database (Riyadh)
- Global Database

Upon retrieving the data, it was extracted on a CSV file for further evaluation.

## Data Selection & Manipulation
Once the data has been extracted on CSV, it was possible to further evaluate the data on Excel. To provide a more accurate and useful dataset for comparison a range of the common years only was chosen.

Moreover, due to fluctuations in yearly averages, the data was evaluated considering moving averages (7-years) to provide smoother results during data visualization. 

## Data Visualization
Once the dataset was ready, it was time to plug n play. The first chart shows a comparison between the global and local temperature set across the years.<br>

The second plot shows the global average temperature range across all the years to view a trend for the entire dataset.<br>

## Observations
According to line charts, the following observations may be deduced:
1) Riyadh’s weather is much warmer than the global average considering that
the temperature has always been greater in the past couple hundred years. <br />
2) Global average temperature for 10 years MA varies between 8.5 °C to 9.5 °C. <br />
3) Riyadh city average temperature for 10 years MA varies between 24.6°C to 
26.8 °C. <br />
4) In both cases, we can see that the average temperature is gradually increasing
throughout the entire time-frame. <br />
5) The yearly average temperature seems to be increasing abnormally on a global
scale in the last 3-4 decades. The same may be noticed when looking at the
wide-range chart in figure 4 where it is evident that the global average
temperature had fluctuated around the 8 C mark up until approximately 
1890.From then on, we notice an uptrend in the temperature rise. <br />
